# Cloudinary to S3 Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you migrate your 1000+ product images from Cloudinary to AWS S3. The migration is designed to be safe, efficient, and resumable.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd Northlux-server
npm install aws-sdk
```

### Step 2: Set Up AWS S3

1. **Create S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to AWS S3 Console
   - Create a new bucket (e.g., `northlux-product-images`)
   - Choose your preferred region
   - Keep default settings (ACLs disabled is fine)

2. **Set Bucket Policy for Public Read Access**:
   - Go to your bucket ‚Üí Permissions ‚Üí Bucket Policy
   - Add this policy (replace `your-bucket-name` with your actual bucket name):
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Create IAM User**:
   - Go to AWS IAM Console
   - Create new user with programmatic access
   - Attach policy with S3 permissions (see below)
   - Save Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

4. **IAM Policy** (attach to your user):
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:
```env
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name

# Existing variables (keep these)
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
API_SECRETE=your-cloudinary-api-secret
```

### Step 4: Test Your Setup
```bash
node scripts/testS3Connection.js
```

This will verify:
- AWS credentials are correct
- S3 bucket is accessible
- Upload/delete permissions work

### Step 5: Run Dry Run
```bash
node scripts/migrateCloudinaryToS3.js dry-run
```

This will show you:
- How many images need migration
- Current storage breakdown
- No actual changes made

### Step 6: Start Migration
```bash
node scripts/migrateCloudinaryToS3.js migrate
```

## üìä What to Expect

### Performance
- **Batch Size**: 10 images processed simultaneously
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-second delay between batches
- **Speed**: ~50-100 images per minute (depends on image sizes)
- **Duration**: 1000 images ‚âà 10-20 minutes

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time console output
- Progress percentage
- Success/failure counts
- Detailed logs saved to `scripts/logs/`

### Error Handling
- Continues processing if some images fail
- Keeps original URLs for failed migrations
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
- Can resume migration if interrupted

## üóÇÔ∏è File Organization

### Before (Cloudinary)
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/image/upload/v123456/products/image1.jpg
```

### After (S3)
```
https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/Northlux/products/variants/64a7b8c9d0e1f2g3h4i5j6k7/image1_1703123456789.jpg
```

### S3 Structure
```

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Northlux/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ products/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ variants/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 64a7b8c9d0e1f2g3h4i5j6k7/

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### AWS S3 Pricing (US East 1)
- **Storage**: $0.023 per GB per month
- **PUT Requests**: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests
- **GET Requests**: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests
- **Data Transfer Out**: $0.09 per GB (first 1 GB free)

### Example for 1000 Images
Assuming average image size of 100KB:
- **Total Storage**: ~100 GB
- **Monthly Storage Cost**: ~$2.30
- **One-time Upload Cost**: ~$0.0004
- **Total First Month**: ~$2.30

### Compared to Cloudinary
- Cloudinary: ~$99/month for 100GB storage + bandwidth
- S3: ~$2.30/month for storage + minimal bandwidth costs
- **Savings**: ~95% reduction in monthly costs

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Batch Size Tuning
Edit `migrateCloudinaryToS3.js`:
```javascript
const BATCH_SIZE = 20; // Increase for faster processing
const DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES = 1000; // Decrease for faster processing
```

### Custom S3 Paths
Modify the `generateS3Key` function to change file organization:
```javascript
const generateS3Key = (originalUrl, variantId) => {
  const filename = extractFilenameFromUrl(originalUrl);
  const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]; // YYYY-MM-DD
  return `products/${date}/${variantId}/${filename}.jpg`;
};
```

## üö® Safety Features

### Resume Capability
- Migration skips already migrated images
- Safe to restart if interrupted
- Checks for S3 URLs in database

### Backup Strategy
- Original Cloudinary URLs preserved if migration fails
- Database updated only after successful S3 upload
- Detailed logs for rollback if needed

### Rollback Process
If you need to rollback:
1. Stop the migration process
2. Use the migration log to identify successfully migrated images
3. Run a custom script to restore Cloudinary URLs from the log

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"AWS credentials not found"**
   ```bash
   # Check .env file
   cat .env | grep AWS
   ```

2. **"NoSuchBucket" error**
   - Verify bucket name in S3 console
   - Check AWS region matches

3. **"AccessDenied" error**
   - Verify IAM permissions
   - Check bucket policy

4. **Network timeouts**
   - Increase delays between requests
   - Check internet connection stability

5. **MongoDB connection issues**
   - Verify MONGODB_URI
   - Check database accessibility

### Performance Issues

1. **Slow processing**
   - Increase BATCH_SIZE (but monitor memory usage)
   - Decrease delays (but respect rate limits)
   - Check network bandwidth

2. **Memory issues**
   - Decrease BATCH_SIZE
   - Ensure temp files are being cleaned up

3. **High AWS costs**
   - Monitor S3 usage in AWS console
   - Consider using S3 Intelligent-Tiering

## üìû Support

### Before Running Migration
1. ‚úÖ Test S3 connection: `node scripts/testS3Connection.js`
2. ‚úÖ Run dry run: `node scripts/migrateCloudinaryToS3.js dry-run`
3. ‚úÖ Backup database (recommended)
4. ‚úÖ Verify all environment variables

### During Migration
- Monitor console output for errors

2. Check migration logs for any failures
3. Test image uploads for new products
4. Consider cleaning up Cloudinary images (after verification)

## üéØ Next Steps After Migration

1. **Update Image Upload Logic**:
   - Modify your upload controllers to use S3 instead of Cloudinary
   - Update image processing pipelines

2. **CDN Setup** (Optional but recommended):
   - Set up CloudFront distribution
   - Configure caching for better performance

3. **Monitoring**:
